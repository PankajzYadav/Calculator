# Calculator
Calculator using HTML, CSS and Javascript

How to use :-

1. Numbers and operators(+,-,*,/) can be entered by clicking on the respective number buttons.
2. Decimal button adds a decimal at the end of the currently typed number.
3. 'DEL' deletes the last entered number until the string becomes empty.
4. 'C' button clears the result screen.
5. Enter a number(say x) and pressing '%' will calculate the percentage of that particular number which we can multiply with some other number(say y) to calculate x%y.
6. Enter a number and press x^2 button would print the square of the entered number on the screen.
7. Pressing '=' will calculate and print the result of the entered mathematical expression on the screen.

Note - If the number is very big, it'd be truncated to avoid overflow.
